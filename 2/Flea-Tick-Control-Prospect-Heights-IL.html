<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies. IPM considers the community as a whole and takes into consideration a balanced mix of the abovementioned control techniques to produce the most efficient and least harmful plan.</p>
<p>Monitoring and identification minimizes the threats of utilizing the incorrect type of pesticide, or utilizing pesticides when other methods will be more effective.

Cultural practices - depend on a method to make the crop or environment unacceptable to pests by disrupting their oviposition choices, host plant discrimination or place by both adults and immatures.</p>
