<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical approaches such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural enemies.

Cultural practices - depend on a method to make the crop or environment unacceptable to pests by disrupting their oviposition choices, host plant discrimination or place by both adults and immatures.</p>
