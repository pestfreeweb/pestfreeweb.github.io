<p>Although botanical extracts such as azadirachtin and pyrethrins, and microbe-derived poisonous metabolites such as avermectin and spinosad are regarded as biologicals (Lasota and Dybas 1991, Sarfraz et al. 2005, Dodia et al. 2010 ), they are still chemical particles, comparable to artificial chemicals, and have a number of the human and environmental security risks as chemical pesticides.</p>
<p>Biological control has actually been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To attend to invasive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is normally used where natural enemies from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Dick 2018 ).
