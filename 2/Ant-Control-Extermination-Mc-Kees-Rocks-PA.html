<p>We traditionally have offered nature short, both in its capability to neutralize the efficiency of ecologically unsound techniques along with its selection of fundamental strengths that can be used to keep pest organisms within bounds.

The term pest" describes more than one cause of problems consisting of diseases, undesirable insects, termites, nematodes, mollusks and weeds. A variety of treatment techniques have been used, including chemical approaches, such as pesticide applications and toxic gas fumigations; and non-chemical treatments, such as freezing or heating up the products, using micro-waves, gamma radiation, modified atmospheres, and anoxic fumigation.</p>
<p>Under this plan, pest control was "monitored" by qualified entomologists and insecticide applications were based upon conclusions reached from routine tracking of pest and natural-enemy populations. We can treat a large variety of pests discovered in Texas, consisting of spiders, ants, termites, fleas, ticks, roaches, bed bugs, rodents and other intruders.
