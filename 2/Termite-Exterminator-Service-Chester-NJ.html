<p>WebMD veterinary specialists answer frequently asked questions about fleas and ticks on your pet. Socio-psychological factors consisting of ethical and rational considerations were found to the motorists in IPM execution in Iran (Rezaei et al. 2019 ). A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or disease incident and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ).
