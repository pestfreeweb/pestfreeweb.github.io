<p>Natural enemies such as parasitic wasps and predatory arthropods can be very reliable in causing substantial decreases in pest populations in specific situations (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially offered natural enemies or conserving natural opponent populations by providing havens or avoiding practices that hurt them are a few of the typical practices to control endemic pests.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a process that is used to control pest populations while reducing the effect on individuals and the surrounding environment. Though there is a controversy of using chemicals due to ecological pollution it is a fact that this is the only approach which is extensively accepted and gave reliable control of pest.</p>
<p>Screens, drifting row covers, or food containers with tight-fitting lids which act as barriers to pests. Pest control is the policy and management of any species which comes under the definition of pests. One threat of using pesticides is that pests might develop resistance, which indicates the pesticide is no longer effective. Use soil management practices that encourage damage of over-wintering pests.</p>
