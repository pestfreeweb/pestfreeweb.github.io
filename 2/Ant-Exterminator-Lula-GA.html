<h3>Termite Removal Cost Lula GA 30554</h3>

<p>IPM approaches consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically harmful levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the smallest reliable dose when other approaches of pest control have actually failed. IPM is an ecosystem-based method that focuses on long-lasting avoidance of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as biological control, environment manipulation, adjustment of cultural practices, and usage of resistant varieties.</p>
<p>The Georgia Pest Management Handbook provides current information on choice, application, and safe use of pest control chemicals.
