<p>4 ). With its success in lots of parts of the world, IPM is viewed as a affordable and ecologically benign pest control technique ideally suited for both small and large farmers all over the world. When termites have actually gone into a building, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more.
