Using entomopathogenic bacteria, fungis, microsporidia, nematodes, or infections, and fermentation byproducts of some microbes versus arthropod pests, plant parasitic nematodes, and plant pathogens normally come under microbial control (Mankau 1981, Paulitz and Bélanger 2001, Dong and Zhang 2006, Lacey 2017 ).</p>
<p>Stay alert and call your pest control expert for a follow-up treatment if you ever see pests returning after treatment. Modern crop ranges frequently unintentionally develop conditions which prefer pest species (e.g., pest types which have tired deeper into larger fruit making them inaccessible to natural enemies). Anticipate SARS-CoV-2 to act like an invasive species presented to a new location when resources abound (that is, people without resistance) and there are no biological controls to keep the population in check or signed up items to use in management (such as federally authorized medications).</p>
