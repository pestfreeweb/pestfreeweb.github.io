<p>A few of these are: neem spray, prepared from neem kernels (Azadirachta indica) extract, efficient against sucking pests, jassids, bollworms and thrips; pyrethrum, prepared from powdered flower heads or liquid extracts of chrysanthemum, reliable versus red cotton bug, cutworms, grasshoppers; botanical mixes, combinations of extracts from different plants such as castor, thorn apple, lantana, custard apple, sweet potato leaves, tomato leaves, ginger, chilly, gliricidia, marigold, and so on</p>
