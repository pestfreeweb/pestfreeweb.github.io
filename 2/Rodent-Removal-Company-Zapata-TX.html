<p>Pest management requires a holistic approach to combating yield-impacting pests. The chemical controls are applied just after routine monitoring shows that a pest population had reached a financial threshold level. Many individual commodity growers, for such crop as potatoes and strawberries, are working to define what IPM means for their crop and area, and IPM-labeled foods are available in minimal locations.</p>
<p>The determination of the right cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is necessary in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest. Insecticides hazardous to a lot of insects (broad-spectrum) will more adversely affect natural enemies than products that are selective or narrow-spectrum for particular insect species or life stages.</p>
<p>National Pesticide Info Center: Provides unbiased, science-based info about pesticides to make it possible for individuals to make educated choices about pesticides use. Mix pesticides according to label guidelines. Waage (39) recommends that biopesticides could form the methadone of IPM," assisting agroecosystems to recover from the habit of calendar spraying while we are upgrading and nurturing them to a more self-renewing capacity.</p>
