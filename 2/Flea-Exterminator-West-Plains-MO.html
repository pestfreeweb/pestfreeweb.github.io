Integrated pest management (IPM) is a strategy that avoids pest damage with minimum adverse influence on human health, the environment and non-target organisms.</p>
<p>Termites consume furnishings, documents, books, and even files kept in safes and lockers, thus causing enormous damage within simply a few months.
