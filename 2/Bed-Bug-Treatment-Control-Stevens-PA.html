<p>Termites are nasty consumers. For some tasks, pest control workers use a mix of pest management techniques, a practice referred to as incorporated pest management. The cornerstone of an efficient IPM program is a schedule of regular assessments. Crop losses due to weeds, arthropods, and illness, though disputed by some as a valid step, have actually increased on a world basis from 34.9% in 1965 (3) to 42.1% in 1988-1990 (4) in spite of the surge of pest control.</p>
