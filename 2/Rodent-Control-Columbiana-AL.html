<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal does of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down advancement and feeding and are subject to greater parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). To put it simply, an effective, nondisruptive method to manage a moderate beet armyworm outbreak might be to retard its advancement and damage while offering the parasitoids time to work, thus enhancing the parasitoids' result throughout subsequent generations.</p>
