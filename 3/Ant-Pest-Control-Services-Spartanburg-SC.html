<p>Thank you for selecting RID Pest Control to protect your home from termites. In Asia, different stages of IPM have actually been effectively embraced in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>Bug, weed, and illness issues are decreased through natural control by the enriched natural enemy animals, using weed-competitive or illness- and pest-resistant varieties (with a focus on long lasting systems for resistance), reduction of nitrogen fertilization, and cautious use of chemical pest control based on careful population tasting and decision limits.</p>
