<p>Bug, weed, and disease issues are decreased through natural control by the enriched natural enemy animals, the use of weed-competitive or disease- and pest-resistant varieties (with a focus on long lasting systems for resistance), decrease of nitrogen fertilization, and judicious use of chemical pest control based on mindful population tasting and choice thresholds.</p>

The advantage of the misting pest control method is that it's thought about to be eco-friendly, it's odor free and does not leave any residues that are hard to be cleaned. Cultural practices - depend on a strategy to make the crop or habitat inappropriate to pests by hindering their oviposition preferences, host plant discrimination or place by both grownups and immatures.</p>
<p>Biological control has been effectively utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To deal with intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control method is typically used where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, increased, and released in the new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control technique that has been effectively used versus a variety of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
