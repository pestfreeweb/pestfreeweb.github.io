<p>IPM is utilized in agriculture, cultivation, forestry, human habitations, preventive preservation and general pest control, consisting of structural pest management, grass pest management and ornamental pest management.

<p>The success of control techniques must be determined using indications based upon monitoring of hazardous organisms, beneficials, pesticide usage, and impact on the environment.
