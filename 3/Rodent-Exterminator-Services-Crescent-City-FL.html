<p>IPM techniques consist of both chemical and nonchemical methods to avoid and control pest populations from reaching economically destructive levels. In IPM, pesticides are utilized at the tiniest effective dose when other techniques of pest control have stopped working. IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that concentrates on long-lasting prevention of pests or their damage through a mix of strategies such as biological control, environment control, adjustment of cultural practices, and use of resistant ranges.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family insect pests. Lots of anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simplistic meaning of IPM - they see IPM as being almost exclusively about decreasing pesticide use.

In a metaanalysis of data of 145 studies, the efficiency of either parasitoids or predators was demonstrated to be good in minimizing the number of pests and increasing pest death (Stiling and Cornelissen, 2005).</p>
