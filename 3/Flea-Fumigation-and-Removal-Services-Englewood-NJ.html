<p>The many varying hazards from pests make it a good idea for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures. In these countries, regular usage of pesticides is restricted to high worth (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly centered on cotton, sugarcane, soybean, and rice.</p>
<p>In contrast, insecticides that are more selective because they are most efficient against insects with certain feeding routines, at certain life phases, or within certain taxonomic groups, are described as "biorational" pesticides. Established in 1967, it is the leading association of the expert pest management markets, with over 350 members throughout the nation.</p>
