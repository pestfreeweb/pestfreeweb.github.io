<p>The many varying hazards from pests make it a good idea for cultural heritage organizations to develop an Integrated Preventive Pest Management program for their collections and structures. In these countries, regular usage of pesticides is restricted to high worth (cash) crops and, as such, IPM adoption is mostly centered on cotton, sugarcane, soybean, and rice.</p>

Established in 1967, it is the leading association of the expert pest management markets, with over 350 members throughout the nation.</p>
