<p>When pest problems are prevented, pests are not present to do damage, so no control steps are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis solutions or its cry toxins in genetically modified crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
<p>Termites consume furnishings, documents, books, and even files kept in lockers and safes, hence triggering gigantic damage within simply a couple of months. This stops the pest getting resistance to chemicals produced by the plant or applied to the crops. Exterminators go to customer homes and businesses to inspect for insects or rodents.
