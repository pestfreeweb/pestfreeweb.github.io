<p>Biological control has been successfully utilized in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialized crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is usually utilized where natural enemies from the native area of the intrusive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control technique that has been effectively utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
