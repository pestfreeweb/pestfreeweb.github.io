<p>In Asia, various phases of IPM have actually been successfully adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, veggies), USA (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (veggies, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
<p>Whether you have rodents or routine pests like roaches, spiders, or ants, we will determine the source of the issue. The objective is to supply a general understanding of the principles of IPM, together with the concepts for implementation in all crops. When a crop is under stress it can be less capable of dealing with the tension triggered by insects that extract plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this tension might somewhat lower the economic threshold.</p>
<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a procedure that is used to control pest populations while reducing the effect on people and the surrounding environment. Though there is a controversy of using chemicals due to ecological contamination it is a fact that this is the only method which is commonly accepted and provided effective control of pest.</p>
<p>In contrast, natural food production applies many of the same principles as IPM but limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, instead of artificial chemicals. Other claims include decreases in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into several crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
