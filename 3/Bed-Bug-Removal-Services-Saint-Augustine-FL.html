<h3>How To Find The Best Pest Control Services Saint Augustine FL</h3>
<p>Although multiple sources define IPM in various methods, previous designs mostly focused on the environmental, and to some level on the evolutionary, elements of pest management (Peterson et al. 2018 ). A current IPM pyramid presented by Stenberg (2017) recognized a lack of a holistic IPM method that utilizes both traditional and modern tools.</p>
<p>We take a look at the big photo and focus on long term prevention of pests by carrying out pre-treatment inspections, determining conditions conducive to pests, de-webbing, positioning of keeping track of devices, sanitation recommendations, prevention & exemption, and using pesticides in a strategic and safe way are all examples of how Mills PM executes the practices of IPM.</p>
