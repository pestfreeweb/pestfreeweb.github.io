<p>Properly recognize pests and beneficials on sticky cards and plants. The knowledge of different control options, pest biology and damage capacity, and suitability of readily available resources makes it possible for the grower to make a decision suitable for their circumstance.

Flexibility and Time- The process of pest control takes time and efforts. Pests are unwanted plants, animals, insects, bacteria or other organisms that disrupt human activity.</p>
<p>Here are some natural, non-toxic ways to control family bug pests. Many anti-pesticide NGOs have a much more simple definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about lowering pesticide usage. If all other integrated pest management methods are not able to keep an insect pest population listed below an economic limit, then usage of an insecticide to control the pest and avoid economic loss is warranted.</p>
<p>Chemical pesticides are categorized into various groups based on their mode of action (IRAC 2018) and rotating chemicals from various mode of action groups is advised to lower the threat of resistance development (Stimulates and Nauen 2015 ). Federal government guidelines restrict the time and amount of certain chemical pesticides and help reduce the involved dangers.</p>
