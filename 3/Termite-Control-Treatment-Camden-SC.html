<p>Well-informed field crews will be able to recognize and keep track of pest problems and efficiently perform the management techniques. The principle of incorporated pest management (IPM) came from nearly 60 years earlier in reaction to these unfavorable effects of pesticides. Several of the resources noted at the end of this leaflet can be used for recognition of insect pests impacting collections.</p>
<p>The human response depends on the value of the damage done, and will vary from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely remove the pest. Recent experiences with bug pest management for cotton in the southeastern United States will be used for crucial examples in the conversation.
