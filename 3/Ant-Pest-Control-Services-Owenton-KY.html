<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecosystem technique to crop production and security that combines different management methods and practices to grow healthy crops and lessen making use of pesticides. By completing and using an IPM strategy, members may have the ability to conserve cash on pest control methods which were previously used and can possibly lower future issues with pesticide resistance on farm.

<p>These might or might not include products noted on the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) 15 Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides used in organic farming and organic gardening are usually much safer than artificial pesticides, they are not constantly more ecologically friendly or safe than artificial pesticides and can cause harm.</p>
<p>In recommendation to the concept of incorporating the use of other and biological controls in complementary methods, the term was later on widened to accept coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and artificial practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural enemies are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural enemies have been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of scientists to have higher levels of resistance.</p>
<p>Based on a recently released report by Fortune Business Insights entitled, Pest Control Market Size, Share & Market Analysis, By Pest Type (Insects, Termites, Rodents, Others), Technique (Chemical, Mechanical, and Biological), Application (Residential, Commercial, and Industrial), and Regional Forecast, 2020 - 2027," the market value was USD 19.73 billion in 2019 and is expected to increase at a CAGR of 6.31% during the projection period, 2020 to 2027.</p>
