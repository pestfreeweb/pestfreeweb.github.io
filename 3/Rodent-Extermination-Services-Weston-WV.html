With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is deemed a ecologically benign and affordable  pest control technique ideally matched for both small and large farmers all over the world. Once termites have actually gotten in a structure, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more.
