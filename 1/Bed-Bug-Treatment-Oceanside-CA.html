<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been recommended as an IPM strategy by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove since growers were not all set for such an intercropping arrangement.

<p>Biological control has been successfully used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To resolve invasive pest problems, classical biological control method is generally utilized where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new habitat of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterilized insects is another biological control strategy that has actually been efficiently utilized against a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ).</p>
