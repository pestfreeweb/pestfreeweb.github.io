Do not mix pesticides. There are four major parts in the brand-new IPM design that attend to different pest management options, the understanding, and resources the grower has to address the pest problem, planning and organization of details to take proper management actions, and maintaining great communication to obtain and disseminate knowledge about pests and their management.</p>
