Low-Risk Pesticides: Non-chemical methods including prevention are the very first line of defense. Chemical manages consist of horticultural oils or the application of insecticides and herbicides.</p>

Almost every kind of pest presents a danger to the homes they live in, whether it's a squirrel in the attic or termites under the floorboards. Beyond Pesticides supports the execution of an Ecological Pest Management (EPM) or highly defined Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program in the indoor environment, and Organic Land Care (OLC) practices in the outdoor environment.</p>
