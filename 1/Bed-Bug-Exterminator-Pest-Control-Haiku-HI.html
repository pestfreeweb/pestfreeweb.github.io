<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to attract and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM tactic by Swezey et al. (2007 ), the idea did not remove due to the fact that growers were not ready for such an intercropping arrangement.

<p>When pest problems are avoided, pests are not present to do damage, so no control measures are required. Arthropod resistance to abamectin (Stumpf and Nauen 2002 ), B. thuringiensis solutions or its cry contaminants in genetically customized crops (Hama et al. 1992, Tabashnik et al. 2013 ), spinosad (Scott 2008 ), and other biopesticides (Dara 2017) are well documented.</p>
<p>Pests can become a costly problem for your business if left to their own devices.
