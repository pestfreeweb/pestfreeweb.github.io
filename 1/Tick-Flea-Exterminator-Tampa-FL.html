<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to bring in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has been advised as an IPM technique by Swezey et al.

<p>A specific pest can be controlled by specific choices, however they might not all be offered in a specific location, for a specific crop, or within the offered monetary methods. IPM involves using the best mix of cultural, chemical and biological measures for specific circumstances, consisting of plant biotechnology as appropriate. This planning consists of attention to field histories to expect what the pest issues might be, picking crop varieties which are resistant or tolerant to pest damage, choosing tillage systems that will suppress anticipated pest damage while offering the crop the greatest yield capacity.</p>
<p>Pests controlled: Usage horticultural oils to combat aphids, termites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies.
