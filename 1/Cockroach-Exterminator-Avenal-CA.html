<p>Although planting alfalfa strips in strawberry fields to draw in and vacuum the western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus, has actually been suggested as an IPM technique by Swezey et al.

If your center currently uses an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program, you will not be amazed to hear that the pest control market has and will continue to approach least-impact services and products.</p>
<p>Recent studies record the need for ongoing decreases in hazardous pesticide usage and practices.
