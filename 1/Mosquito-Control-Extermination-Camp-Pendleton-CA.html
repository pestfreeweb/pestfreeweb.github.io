All setting off a bug bomb" does is cover your possessions with toxic chemicals, destroy the air quality in your house or business, possibly contaminate food and other perishables, and only kills pests at the surface of the problem.</p>
<p>Without controls on population development, organisms can quickly accomplish levels at which damage is triggered hence ending up being pests (e.g., locust swarms stripping landscapes bare).
