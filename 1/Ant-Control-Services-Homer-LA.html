<p>Effective, less dangerous pest controls are picked first, including extremely targeted chemicals, such as pheromones to interrupt pest breeding, or mechanical control, such as trapping or weeding. Examination is frequently one of the most crucial actions in Integrated Pest Management (Bennett et al., 2005 ). It is the process of reviewing an IPM program and the outcomes it has produced.</p>
<p>Since the term IPM has been coopted by the chemical market to indicate practically anything a practitioner desires it to suggest, Beyond Pesticides has actually welcomed the phrase Ecological Pest Management." Ecological Pest Management better represents the focus practitioners require to have -highlighting the broader ecology of pest management and preventing poisonous chemicals unless there are no options.</p>
