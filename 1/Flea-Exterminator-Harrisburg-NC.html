<p>Simultaneously, it is also based upon semiochemicals especially allomones and kairomones 35 The pests are fended off or discouraged away from a plant (push) through allomones that can be repellents or deterrents and are simultaneously drawn in (pull) by kairomones to trap crops where they can be killed or eliminated 35 (Figure 5 ). A lot of pesticide issues are triggered by a small number of the pesticides readily available today.</p>
<p>Screens, floating row covers, or food containers with tight-fitting covers which function as barriers to pests. Pest control is the guideline and management of any types which comes under the meaning of pests. One threat of utilizing pesticides is that pests might establish resistance, which means the pesticide is no longer reliable.
