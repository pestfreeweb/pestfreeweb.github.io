<p>We traditionally have sold nature short, both in its capability to reduce the effects of the effectiveness of environmentally unsound approaches along with its range of intrinsic strengths that can be utilized to keep pest organisms within bounds. For instance, strains of predaceous mites, rove beetles, lacewings, and species of parasitoids have been selected for increased levels of resistance to insecticides, thus increasing the likelihood that some will endure insecticide treatments directed at pests.</p>
