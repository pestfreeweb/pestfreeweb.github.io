<p>The brand-new ribonucleic acid disturbance (RNAi) technology where double-stranded RNA is used to silence specific genes in the target insect is considered as biopesticide application (Gordon and Waterhouse 2007 ). Specific biostimulants based on minerals, microbes, plant extracts, seaweed or algae impart caused systemic resistance to pests, illness, and abiotic stressors, however are applied as amendments with no claims for pest or disease control (Larkin 2008, Vleesschauwer and Höfte 2009, Sharma et al. 2014, López-Bucio et al 2015, Dara 2018a ).
