The objective is to supply a general understanding of the ideas of IPM, together with the concepts for implementation in all crops. When a crop is under tension it can be less efficient in handling the stress triggered by insects that draw out plant sap (e.g. aphids, leafhoppers) and this stress might a little decrease the economic threshold.</p>
<p>Pests managed: Use horticultural oils to combat aphids, mites, beetles, leaf miners, caterpillars, thrips, leafhoppers, and whiteflies. Under EPM, chemicals need to be used only as a last hope, after mechanical, cultural, and biological techniques have been tried and revealed inefficient.
