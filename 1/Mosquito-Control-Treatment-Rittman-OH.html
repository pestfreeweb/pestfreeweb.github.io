<p>Rodents reside in cities near individuals due to the fact that they can find ideal food, water, and shelter to join our city lifestyle.

<p>The decision of the correct cause of pest problem (understanding pest biology) and ecology is essential in manipulating the environment to the crop's benefit and to the hinderance of the pest.
