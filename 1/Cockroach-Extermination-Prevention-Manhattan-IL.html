<p>Stay watchful and call your pest control professional for a follow-up treatment if you ever see pests returning after treatment. Modern crop varieties frequently inadvertently develop conditions which favor pest types (e.g., pest species which have actually bored deeper into bigger fruit making them unattainable to natural enemies).
